# Restaurant Menu CMS

As with some of my other personal portfolio work, this project serves as a playground where I can explore and experiment with new (well, new-to-me) technologies.

Still very much in its infancy stage, this Ruby on Rails application is one part of a decoupled software system fronted by an eCommerce React application.

## System integrations:
  * **Frontend**: React
  * **Backend**: Node/Express
  * **API/ Data management layer**: Ruby on Rails

  [View the Frontend code here.](https://github.com/sds-smith/restaurant_menu)  
  [View the Express server code here.](https://github.com/sds-smith/ecomm_server)

This Rails server exposes:
  * A cors-configured API namespace which returns JSON menu data to populate the frontend app,
  * An auth protected browser-based CMS tool for managing that menu data

Stay tuned for updates . . .
